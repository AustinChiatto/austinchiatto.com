I build full-stack tools to solve problems, daydream of finding the perfect notes app, and try every day to give more than I take.

Currently, I work as a front-end developer building websites at [Forge and Smith](https://forgeandsmith.com/). Previously at [Dovetail Digital](https://www.dovetaildigital.ca/).
